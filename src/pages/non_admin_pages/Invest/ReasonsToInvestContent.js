                    Agriculture in San Vicente, Camarines Norte plays a pivotal role in the local economy, serving as its backbone. This sector not only sustains the population but also provides livelihood opportunities, supplies raw materials to industries, and fuels economic growth through trade and business activities. The agricultural landscape of San Vicente primarily focuses on the cultivation of major crops such as coconut, pineapple, and rice.<br>
                    </br><br></br>
                    In addition to these staples, the Municipality also engages in small-scale production of vegetables, livestock, poultry, and fisheries.

Furthermore, the production of coconut and pineapple fiber plays a significant role in the local economy and is facilitated by the Fabrica Manpower Fiber Association.<br>
                    </br><br></br>
                    To further support and enhance farming activities, the Local Government Unit (LGU) of San Vicente through Municipal Agricultural Office in coordination with various government agencies offers specialized training programs and initiates livelihood projects aimed at increasing farmers' productivity and improving the overall agricultural sector in the Municipality.
