                San Vicente, formally recognized as the Municipality of San Vicente, is a town of the 5th class located in the province of Camarines Norte, Philippines. As of the 2020 census, it is home to a population of approximately 12,579 residents. The Mananap Falls is approximately 20â€“25 ft tall, tucked inside the thick forest and mountains. The water was ice cold, and there is a small raft tied which will lead you near the falls and a ladder to get to the top of the falls. There is a jumping point as well. It is more than this we-attitude that is practiced by the people, each one treating the other as more than a neighbor. A large segment of the population is related by blood.
